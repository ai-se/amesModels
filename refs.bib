                  states that you need to tag all transitions in a
                  microstep and then take them all at once. This will
                  provide deterministic execution; however, you must
                  keep track of all the transitions you have taken and
                  possibly adjust the tags in the future if events
                  within the microstep cause transitions out of a
                  superstate. }}
